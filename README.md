# Employee Management System (EMS) - Full Stack Project


The **Employee Management System (EMS)** is a full-stack web application designed to manage employee information efficiently.  
It allows users to **add new employees, view employee details, update existing records, and delete employees**.  

The backend is built using **Java Spring Boot**, the frontend is developed with **React.js**, and **MySQL** is used for persistent data storage. The project demonstrates full-stack development skills including REST API design, frontend integration, and database management.

## My Contributions
- Developed **backend REST APIs** for employee operations (Add, Update, Delete, View).  
- Implemented **Spring Boot service and repository layers** for business logic and database interaction.  
- Designed **frontend using React.js**, creating forms for adding and updating employees and tables to display employee lists.  
- Integrated frontend with backend APIs using **Axios** for real-time data operations.  
- Performed **unit testing** of backend functionalities using **JUnit**.  
- Maintained project version control using **Git/GitHub**.  
- Included **project screenshots** to demonstrate the application output.
